RSA algorithm is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1977. The algorithm is based on the fact that it is easy to multiply large prime numbers, but it is extremely difficult to factor their product. RSA algorithm is used for secure data transmission and digital signature verification.

steps for the RSA algorithm:

1. Select two large prime numbers, p and q.
2. Calculate n = p * q.
3. Calculate the totient of n: φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1).
4. Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and e is coprime to φ(n). This will be the public key exponent.
5. Calculate the private key exponent d satisfy de=1+xphi(n).or

         or

                d=(1+phi(n))/e      

               d=inverse(e,phi)———python code

1. Publish the public key (n, e).
2. Keep the private key (d) secret.
3. To encrypt a message, M, convert it to an integer m such that 0 <= m < n. Then, compute c ≡ m^e (mod n).
4. To decrypt the ciphertext, c, compute m ≡ c^d (mod n).

This algorithm is used for secure data transmission and digital signature verification, as it provides 

a secure way to encrypt messages and verify the identity of the sender.

**what is co-prime:**

Two numbers are said to be coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1. In other words, they share no common factors other than 1. For example, 21 and 25 are coprime because their only common factor is 1, whereas 15 and 21 are not coprime because they share a common factor of 3.

**python code for the rsa-algorithm:**

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import inverse

p = 61
q = 53
m = int(input("Enter value of m : "))
n = p * q 

phi =(p-1)*(q-1)
e = 17 
d = inverse(e,phi)
print("value of d :"+ str(d))
c = pow(m,e,n)
print("value of c :"+ str(c))

m =pow(c,d,n)
print("vlaue of m : "+ str(m))
```

 **If from Crypto.Util.number import inverse** is not working in vs code:

To import the **`Crypto.Util.number`** module in VSCode, you need to have the **`pycryptodome`** package installed. Here's how you can install it and import the module:

1. Open the terminal in VSCode. You can do this by going to the menu and selecting **`View -> Terminal`**.
2. In the terminal, type the following command to install the **`pycryptodome`** package:
    
    ```
    pip install pycryptodome
    ```
    
3. Wait for the installation to complete. Once it's done, you can import the **`Crypto.Util.number`** module in your Python code using the following line:
    
    ```
    from Crypto.Util.number import inverse
    ```
    

With the **`pycryptodome`** package installed and the import statement added to your code, you should be able to use the **`inverse`** function without any errors.
